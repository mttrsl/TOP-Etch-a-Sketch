# TOP-Etch-a-Sketch

This is my Etch-a-Sketch submission for The Odin Project. In this project I have used a mixture of HTML & CSS to build the UI for the drawer, then used JS scripts to enable the user to draw on the etch-a-sketch and use the button functions below. 

I would like to update the project in the future to use a grid slider for the size instead of a prompt, and also a color picker that lets the user choose the color they would like to draw with.
